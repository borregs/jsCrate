# jsCrate

This JS Directory unfortunattly has no theme or speciffic subject. 
Javascript is so versatile and usefull it would be hard to properly categorize each file...

so far archives include NodeJS backends, angular webapps and JS navigation function files (could be malicious if used improperly)
